# Project Title

## Description

A simple Neural Network implementation in C++. The main file contains examples of using the network to solve the Wine and Iris classification problems, as well as templates of training and testing functions.
The class implements a fully connected feedforward neural network with backpropagation and gradient descent. The implementation is fully written in C++ and does not use any external libraries.

### Dependencies

* OpenCV - Optional, for result visualization
* MAKE - For building
